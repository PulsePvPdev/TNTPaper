TNTPaper is a plugin which allows you to use a piece of paper to store TNT. I made this plugin a while ago and decided to upload it later on. This isn't a very efficient plugin however, it does the job. I might consider recoding it in the future to drastically improve it's efficiency however, there is no use for it on any server.
